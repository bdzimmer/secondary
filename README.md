# Secondary

Secondary is a tool for worldbuilding. Describe a world consisting of complex hierarchies of characters, locations, events, or other concepts using YAML and Markdown in text files which are straightforward to read and edit. Special tags track relationships between concepts and indicate tasks or thoughts. Compile your world into a static web site, browse and review tasks, then edit and compile again.

Secondary integrates with Google Drive and Drive Notepad, so you can easily view and edit your world whenever inspiration strikes.
