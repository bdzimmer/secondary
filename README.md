# Secondary
Secondary is a tool for worldbuilding. It allows you to describe a world consisting of complex hierarchies of characters, locations, events, or other concepts using YAML and Markdown in text files which are straightforward to read and edit. Special tags track relationships between concepts and indicate tasks or thoughts. Secondary can then export your world into a beautiful static web site. It integrates with Google Drive and Drive Notepad, so you can easly view and update your world whenever inspiration strikes.
