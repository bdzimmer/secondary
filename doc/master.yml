description: create worlds from text
notes: |-
  Secondary is a tool for world building. Use it to plan a novel, create game design documents, and more.
  
  ### Edit
  Describe your world in text files with a combination of YAML and Markdown. Use your favorite text editor; there's no user interface to learn.<br />
  
  ### Organize
  Group characters, places, and ideas into collections and hierarchies however you see fit. Add links and track relationships between things in your world.<br />
  
  ### Plan
  Track writing that needs to completed and ideas that need to be fleshed out at every level.<br />
  
  ### Export
  Export your world to a website, integrating your own image content or public domain images from Wikimedia. Reread, review tasks, and edit!<br />
 
  ### Google Drive Integration
  Store your world files on Google Drive and edit them from anywhere. Export the website for hosting on Google Drive.<br />
