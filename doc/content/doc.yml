    ### Overview
    ***

    A key feature of Secondary is a special set of tags that you can use in the notes of any item. Some of these function like tags in wiki markup, while others have purposes that are more specific to worldbuilding. Tags take the following form:

    `{{demo: tag_name | value | arg1=value1 | arg2=value2 | arg3=value3 ...}}`

    For {{link: tags | Item Tags}}, `value` is usually the id or name of an item in your world. For {{link: tags | Task Tags}}, `value` is usually a sentence or two of descriptive text, and for {{link: tags | Event Tags}}, `value` is a date. Some tags take additional arguments, usually key-value pairs whose order does not matter. Default values for arguments are listed in the usage description for each tag.

    <br />


    ### Item Tags
    ***

    Item tags add relationships between items, insert images and links in notes, or create charts and visualizations.

    <br />

    ***

    #### link

    Create a link to an item.

    **Usage**

    `{{demo: link | item | anchor}}`

    * **item**: name or id of item
    * **anchor** (optional): name of anchor within item's notes; anchors are automatically generated for headings

    Since link is the most often used tag, the "link:" is optional if it is being used without an anchor argument.

    **Examples**

    `{{demo: link | Project Layout}}` &rarr; {{link: Project Layout}}

    `{{demo: link | Tags | Event Tags}}` &rarr; {{link: Tags | Event Tags}}

    ***

    #### image

    {{image: image_red_riding_hood}}

    Insert an image.

    **Usage**

    `{{demo: image | item | link=true}}`

    * **item**: name or id of image or character item
    * **link**: should the image link link back to its page?

    The image will be right aligned with a maximum width of 320px.

    **Example**

    `{{demo: image | image_red_riding_hood}}`

    ***

    #### image-responsive

    Insert a responsive image that fills the width of the page.

    `{{demo: image-responsive | item}}`

    See {{link: Tags | image}} for more details.

    ***

    #### familytree

    Insert a family tree showing a character and their descendants.

    **Usage**

    `{{demo: familytree | character}}`

    * **character**: name or id of character item

    Family relationships are established by using any of the following item tags in the notes of characters:

    * **father**, **mother**, **parent**
    * **son**, **daughter**, **child**
    * **ancestor**
    * **descendant**
    * **marriage**

    For example, the tag `{{demo: mother | Lady Catherine de Bourgh}}` in the notes of {{Anne de Bourgh}} indicates that {{Lady Catherine de Bourgh}} is Anne's mother.

    **birth** and **death** tags in a character's notes will add lifespan dates to their entry in the family tree. See {{link: tags | Event Tags}} below for more about these tags.

    **Examples**

    `{{demo: familytree | Lady Catherine de Bourgh}}`

    {{familytree: Lady Catherine de Bourgh}}

    See {{link: Genealogy Examples}} for further details.

    ***

    #### jumbotron

    Set the background image, image position, and text color of the article jumbotron.

    **Usage**

    `{{demo: jumbotron | image | xpos=0% | ypos=50% | color=black}}`

    * **image**: name or id of image item
    * **xpos**: image x-position, in percentage (%) or pixels (px)
    * **ypos**: image y-position, in percentage or pixels
    * **color**: text color

    **Examples**

    `{{demo: jumbotron | image_alice | ypos=50%}}`

    {{jumbotron: image_alice | ypos=50%}}

    (see jumbotron at top of page)

    {{todo: test pixels}}

    ***

    #### timeline

    Insert a timeline of all events in a hierarchy of items.

    **Usage**

    `{{demo: timeline | item | format=monthDayParagraph}}`

    * **item**: name or id of an item; events will be gathered from the item and all items underneath it in the heirarchy.
    * **format**: one of several formatting options:
        * **dayTable**: create a heading for each year, and a table for each month. The first cell in the row contains a day of the month, and the second cell contains a paragraph of the events of that day. Best for closely-spaced events.
        * **monthDayParagraph**: create a heading for each year, with a paragraph of the events of each month. Best for events with greater spacing.
        * **yearTable**: create a single table. The first cell in the row contains a year, and the second cell contains a paragraph of the events of that year. Best for events with the greatest spacing.

    Events are described using {{link: tags | Event Tags}}.

    **Example**

    This timeline tag gathers event tags from the examples in the next section.

    `{{demo: timeline | tags | format=monthDayParagraph}}`

    {{timeline: tags | format=monthDayParagraph}}

    ***

    <br />

    ### Event Tags
    ***

    These tags describe events, which can be gathered into a timeline with the {{link: Tags | timeline}} tag. The `value` of an event tag is a date, which can consist of the full month, day, and year; month and year, or year:

    * June 1, 1940
    * June 1940
    * 1940

    The parts of the date must be separated by at least one comma or a whitespace character, with additional whitespace allowed.

    <br />

    ***

    #### birth / death

    Describe the birth or death of a character.

    **Usage**

    `{{demo: birth | date | description}}`
    `{{demo: death | date | description}}`

    * **date**: date of birth or death of the character whose notes this tag appears in
    * **description**: description of the event

    Birth and death tags may be added to any page, but it only make sense to add them to the notes of a character, since they describe the birth and death of that character.

    **Examples**

    {{todo: birth and death examples}}

    ***

    #### event

    `{{demo: event | date | description}}`

    {{todo: event tag documentation}}

    <br />


    ### Task Tags

    `{{demo: task_type | description | log=None | start=None | done=None}}`
