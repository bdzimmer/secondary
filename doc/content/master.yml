description: create worlds from text
notes: |-
  Secondary is a tool for world building. Use Secondary for planning novels, creating game design documents, and more.
  <br /><br />

  ### Edit
  Describe your world in text files with a combination of YAML and Markdown. Use your favorite text editor; there's no user interface to learn.<br /><br />

  ### Organize
  Group characters, places, and ideas into collections and hierarchies however you see fit. Add links and relationships between things in your world.<br /><br />

  ### Plan
  Track writing that needs to completed and ideas that need to be developed.<br /><br />

  ### Export
  Compile your world to a website, integrating your own image content or public domain images from Wikimedia. Browse to review tasks and get ideas, then edit the source files and recompile.<br /><br />

  ### Google Drive Integration
  Store your world's source files on Google Drive and edit them from anywhere. Export the website for hosting on Google Drive.<br /><br />
